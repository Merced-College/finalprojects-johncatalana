Terminal Dungeon Adventure Game

Overview

This is a text-based dungeon exploration game written in Java. The player explores 
rooms, fights monsters, collects items, and can undo their moves using a stack-based backtracking system. 
The game runs entirely in the terminal, with no graphical interface required.

The project was created to fulfill all the Student Learning Outcomes (SLOs) for the course,
including the use of multiple data structures, recursive functions, object-oriented design, 
and algorithm development.

Features

- Move between interconnected dungeon rooms (north, south, east, west).
- Fight monsters in turn-based battles.
- Monsters can drop items when defeated.
- Recursively print player inventory.
- Recursive monster chain attack retaliation.
- Use items such as Health Potions to restore HP.
- Undo previous room movement using a stack.
- Room-specific item pickup and interaction system.

Technical Highlights

- Data Structures Used:
  - Arrays (Item[] inventory)
  - Queue (LinkedList<Monster> for monster order)
  - Stack (Stack<String> for movement undo)
  - HashMap (Map<String, Room> for dungeon layout)
  - Strings for input parsing and naming

- Recursive Functions:
  - printInventoryRecursive() — prints items recursively
  - monsterChainAttack() — monsters attack player in recursive sequence

- Object-Oriented Classes:
  - Player.java – handles inventory, health, actions
  - Room.java – stores monsters, exits, and items
  - Monster.java – enemy logic with HP and attack
  - Item.java – used to define healing and other effects
  - Game.java – main engine that runs everything
